TO MAKE A USABLE UI DESIGN APP I MUST:

    -Make add new style button from a list of known styles
    -Add the ability to remove styles
        > This means that you need to know the original style of the element before application
        > And you need a reset function per style to reset back to the original style upon deletion

-Add the ability to group elements together
-Add serialisation of elements and therefore import, export and save functionality
-Make home page and multiple app pages

-Make separate element lists
    > The select currently on the web page should be the list of elements currently
    in use or was previously used to make the application
    > Make separate functionality to add already known elements to the app for first time use

-Add functionality to create element list presets and app presets where specific elements
already are loaded and can be loaded together (ie. Basic Elements, Todo Elements, Schedule Elements)
